# Bots as a Service
### Joshua Ladd, Kamiar Coffey, Evan Lee


__Project Description__
We seek to develop a web application to facilitate the easy modular construction of reddit bots through a GUI as well as the potential to deploy and host these bots. 

__Current Stack__
We currently plan to deploy this app using Kotlin, with the spin-up of the bots being serverless through AWS Lambda and a service to deploy these bots through Digital Ocean.
